# Query-Guided Resolution in Uncertain Databases
A modular end-to-end framework to manage uncertain data management in a probabilistic database.
We develop an end-to-end novel framework solution for resolving Uncertain Databases using guided queries.
Our solution helps to avoid complete cleaning of the entire database but clean the relevant tuples of the query result.

## Explanation

Over NELL folder we added a simple example of the query format we use to evaluate its query results. (Q13)

## Running The App

```bash
python main.py
```

## Flow:

By running the app, the different variants of the Utility Computation module and the Learner module will evaluate Q13.

## Info. Files:
On the root path of the project, there are two files: ‘TCP-H Queries.pdf’ and ‘NELL Queries.pdf’. Each explains the queries we used from the two datasets (TPC-H and NELL).
